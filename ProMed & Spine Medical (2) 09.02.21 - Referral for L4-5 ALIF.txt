Follow Up Comprehensive Neurosurgical Consultation
History of Present Illness
The patient is here for a follow-up. Initially, we had to cancel her due to concerns regarding
some abdominal pain when she presented on the morning of surgery. She was sent back for
further evaluation. At this time, she is taking blood pressure medication and she has been
given a vial of nitroglycerine to carry around. Her doctors are warning her that her cardiac
condition does not lend itself to surgery.
The patient continues to have the same symptoms as before as it relates to the lower back
and also some neck issues. She does not have any new complaints but her symptoms
remain unchanged.

visit.
*Inspection: Lumbar paravertebral palpation was performed and was significant for
muscle spasm.
*Lumbar Spine: Anterior lumbar flexion causes pain at 40 degrees There is pain noted
with lumbar extension of 10 degrees. Comments: Her examination is consistent with
limited range of motion.

Assessment and Plan
At this point, the patient is not a candidate for surgery given her cardiac function. She will
follow up with her pain management doctor and her other doctors to optimize her cardiac
function. When she is cleared from a medical standpoint, she will contact our office to
proceed with the surgery accordingly. I had discussed this with the patient extensively. She
understands. All questions have been answered and she will be managed symptomatically
by her pain management doctor at this point.
Follow up: As needed
Sincerely,
Topfor

For someone without known diabetes, a hemoglobin
Alc value between 5.7% and 6.4% is consistent with
prediabetes and should be confirmed with a
follow-up test.
For someone with known diabetes, a value <7%
indicates that their diabetes is well controlled. Alc
targets should be individualized based on duration of
diabetes, age, comorbid conditions, and other
considerations.
This assay result is consistent with an increased risk
of diabetes.
Currently, no consensus exists regarding use of
hemoglobin Alc for diagnosis of diabetes for children.

A signed photocopy or facsimile of this Agreement shall be considered valid as the original.
I, Claudia Barrera
(Patient) do hereby authorize physicians of ProMedSPINE to furnish my attorney with a full report of Physician's
examination, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, etc. arising out of the incident on 04/23/2019 (Date of Loss) in which I was involved. I further
authorize and direct my attorney to pay directly, from funds of case settlement, to physicians of ProMedSPINE such sums that are due and owing for
medical services, treatment and care, which have been rendered to me by reason of this accident which are due to Physician's office; and you, my
attorney, are expressly directed to withhold such sums from any payments, settlements, dispositions, proceeds (including my automobile medical
payments coverage), verdicts, and/or any other sources received on my behalf and place them in your trust account for the purpose of adequately
protecting and paying in full and promptly said medical services rendered to me by physicians of ProMedSPINE.
I further direct you, my attorney, to pay to physicians of ProMedSPINE that amount which is due and owing for the medical care, examination,
treatments, and other services, which have been extended on my behalf within thirty days of receipt of said funds. I agree to pay the physicians of
ProMedSPINE in accordance with his/her standard usual and customary rates and not in accordance with any managed care or insurance contract,
which I and/or physicians of ProMedSPINE may have, that provides for a reduced rate, regardless of the reason. Physicians of ProMedSPINE are not
obligated to agree to any reduction in payment for services rendered before or after settlement.
I do fully realize and understand that I remain personally responsible for said medical services and associated medical bills and that this obligation is
not contingent upon my receiving any settlement. With this understanding in mind, I agree to give physicians of ProMedSPINE information
concerning any and all insurance policies, which may cover some of the said medical treatment and hereby assign to Physician the benefits therein. I
further agree to notify physicians of ProMedSPINE, and pay their bills at such time as I may personally receive payments made directly to myself for
these services, from the settlement and/or any medical insurance carrier. If my attorney refuses to sign this lien or I no longer have an attorney
representing me, the entire balance for services rendered are due and payable immediately. I do hereby waive and fully give up my right to claim that
debts are not collectible by any reason of any applicable statute of limitations, or any other penalties caused by this delay at my request. In other
words, I am giving up the right to use as an affirmative defense any statute of limitations or laches, or dismissal for delay, which I may have had a
right to use, for a period of ten (10) years, from the date I place my signature upon this document. I agree to all the fees (fee schedule available upon
request). I understand and agree to a non-negotiable fee of $15-$25K on my lien if I don't show up to a scheduled surgery and/or procedure on the
scheduled day of. The fee for initial Neurosurgical evaluation is $1250 and each follow up visit is $850. The fee for initial Pain Management
evaluation is $900 and each follow up visit is $500. TeleMedicine evaluations and consultations are billed at the same rates as in-person. The fee for
evaluation of each X-ray is $150 and any other imaging is $220. The fee for injections is $6250 and rhizatomies or ablations are $15,000. Fee for an
assistant doctor will be 50% of the primary surgeon. Fees are subject to change without any further notice. Other procedures will be billed separately.
The above fees for surgery or procedure include the fees only for ProMedSPINE doctors. Other third party providers for the facility, technicians,
instrumentation, and other physicians such as anesthesiologists, and others will have separate charges billed by those parties. Those other third party
providers are not a part of ProMedSPINE. Pricing for those services will be provided directly from those providers to you. I direct that physicians of
ProMedSPINE send and my Attorney receive all of my bills from Physician on my behalf.
This medical lien may not be altered, modified, revoked, or compromised in any way without approval of physicians of ProMedSPINE and shall
remain in force and effect at all times until all monies due have been paid. If legal action is necessary to enforce this Agreement, then the prevailing
party shall recover reasonable attorney fees and costs. My Attorney has advised me that I may be waiving certain rights including the right to claim
Statute of Limitation, Laches, other penalties caused by delay as an affirmative defense. The said attorney agrees to notify physicians of
ProMedSPINE within 30 days if said patient substitutes the attorney and supply the name, address, and telephone number of the newly-acquired
attorney and specifically place said attorney on notice of the pending lien (if available). If failure to notify the doctor of such change of attorney shall
result in physicians of ProMedSPINE failure to receive recovery pursuant to this lien, it shall be considered a breach by the undersigned attorney to
the terms of this lien agreement In the event that the attorney may require for the treating physician to be designated as an "Expert Witness" on the
above mentioned case, the attorney and/or the attorney's office staff will obtain a written consent from the treating physician prior to scheduling and/
or naming him/her as the "Expert Witness" for the trial and/or testimony.
I authorize physicians of ProMedSPINE to share my medical records on their password and captcha protected online portal. I understand that this
portal is only accessible with the username and password provided to my attorney, who has signed and agreed below.
The undersigned attorney acknowledges that he/she is legal counsel of record for the above-named patient and that he/she agrees to be bound by all
of those terms of this medical lien.

Risk of Surgery / Fees
I, Claudia Lorena Barrera Roque understand that there are alternative, non-surgical methods of treatment. However, at this
time, I have decided to proceed with the proposed surgical treatment. I have been advised by my surgeon the proposed surgery may carry
risks, not limited to the following: no improvement; having more pain and discomfort of one or more extremities; having more weakness
or paralysis of one or more muscle groups or limbs temporarily or permanently; loss of bowel and bladder and sexual function; chance of
infections, spinal fluid leak, meningitis, or arachnoiditis; progressive neurological deficits; loss of voice; recurrent disk herniation at the
same level or newly ruptured disk at other levels; instability; need for additional surgical treatment, immediately or remotely from the
time of surgery, approached from the front route or from the back (posterior) or side; major blood loss and injuries to major vessels and
organs requiring additional surgical intervention on an urgent basis; need for blood bank transfusion and its possible complications and
transmission of illness such as viral diseases of the HIV group (AIDS) or hepatitis; possibility of instability and need for bone fusion or
use of instrumentation which increases the duration of the procedure and its complication rate; non-union fusion requiring additional
surgical intervention; hardware breakage or displacement and need for its removal; possible need for use of banked bone and transmission
of related illnesses; harvesting of the patient's iliac crest resulting in chronic local pain at the donor site of the iliac bone; blindness,
cardiopulmonary dysfunction, pulmonary emboli, stroke, anaphylactic shock, cardiac arrest, or even death. All of these above have been
brought to my attention. I also understand that other organ failure and complications can occur in addition to the above possibilities. I also
understand and acknowledge that there are no guarantees provided.
While there are other physicians in the community that may offer similar services, every surgeon's experience, skill level, and expertise
may differ. As such, I have been advised to consider all alternatives at my own discretion and have agreed to the charges set forth above
after considering my options. I have been provided information on ProMedSPINE surgeons and their backgrounds, experience, and
expertise in surgery, and have had discussions directly with my surgeon to answer my questions and concerns. I am advised that
ProMedSPINE charges are set by the practice and are based on multiple factors including, but not limited to, the complexity of the
surgery, the risk of performing the surgery, the skill level and experience of the surgeons, as well as the costs associated with offering the
services to the public
C. Bo UBR The fee for surgery (for the primary surgeon and his/her assistant) will be itemized for each step of the procedure separately and
billed as an aggregate amount after the surgery is complete.
OR
C. BX UBR The following outlines the fee for performing the above surgery
$ 60,000.00
for primary surgeon and fifty percent of primary surgeon's fee for the assistant surgeon. I understand that this
fee could increase in the event that there is added complexity, additional steps or levels that may need to be operated on, or other services
that become necessary when the surgeon is in the midst of the procedure.
The above fees for surgery include the fees only for the primary surgeon and his/her assistant. Other third party providers for the facility,
technologists, instrumentation, and other physicians such as anesthesiologists, and others will have separate charges billed by those
parties. Those other third party providers are not a part of ProMedSPINE. Pricing for those services will be provided directly from those
providers to you.
I have been advised and understand that ProMedSPINE, its physicians/staff members, may directly or indirectly be owners or investors in
healthcare products, companies, facilities and services that may be utilized during my care/surgery and agree to proceed being fully
informed of such.

In the course of your treatment, it may be necessary to give you blood or blood products. This form tells you about some of the risks of
receiving blood and about the choices you have.
C.B.
V UBR
My initials in the box prove I have received the information sheet called "If You Need Blood, You Have
Several Options," published by Corus Blood Services.
Initial
RISKS
Although receiving blood or blood products is a common procedure, it does involve some risks. Some of the risks are listed below.
1. Discomfort or bruising may occur at the site where the blood is given.
2.
Minor allergic reactions are common, such as headache, fever, chills, or rash.
3.
Severe reactions can occur, such as difficulty breathing or even death.
. The blood you receive could be contaminated with bacteria which can lead to severe reactions including death.
5. The blood you receive could be contaminated with infectious diseases, such as AIDS or hepatitis.
CHOICES
You may be able to choose where the blood or blood products you receive come from.
A.
Blood from the community blood supply: You can receive blood that has been donated by volunteers to the community blood
bank. This blood has all of the risks described above (See RISKS #1, 2, 3, 4, 5).
B.
Blood from donors you select: Although it has NOT been shown that blood from people you select is any safer than blood from
the community blood supply, you may wish to ask people you know, with your blood type, to donate blood for your use. You may
need to ask several people to donate blood, if you need a lot of blood. If there is not enough blood from donors you select or if their
blood is not useable, you will receive blood from the community blood supply.
C.
Your own blood: Although receiving any blood involves some risks, the safest blood is your own.
. You might be able to donate your own blood or certain parts of your blood before surgery and receive it when you need it.
. Your doctor may have some of the blood you lose during surgery recycled and put back into you.
. Just before surgery, some of your blood could be taken and replaced with other solutions. When you bleed, the lost blood can be
replaced with your own blood.
The advantage of receiving your own blood is that it eliminates the risk of some diseases, such as AIDS or hepatitis. There are still
risks of serious reactions (See RISKS #3 and #4). If there is not enough of your own blood or if your blood is not useable, you will
get blood from donors you have selected or the community blood supply.
Choose one of the following and write your initials in the box next to your choice:
C. KX
CBR
I understand that I can delay my surgery in order to donate my own blood. But I DO NOT want to delay my
surgery, and I chose NOT to donate my own blood before surgery.
Initial
I chose to use my own blood if I meet the medical criteria to do so. If there is not enough of my own blood or if
any blood is not usable, I will receive blood from donors I have selected or from the community blood supply.
Initial
My signature below proves that I have received all of the information I want about blood transfusions, about the risks associated with
blood transfusions, and about the available sources of blood. My signature also proves that I agree to receive blood transfusions if
necessary.

Referral Diagnosis:
Rule out Sciatic syndrom
Findings
The findings of this nerve conduction examination suggest the following. Clinical correlation with the patient's
symptoms and examination is indicated to confirm these findings:
Left Tibial Findings:
1) Prolonged Left Tibial Motor Distal Latency at 9.3 ms
2) Low Left Tibial Motor Distal Amplitude at 0.06 mV
These findings are typically encountered in patients with Left Tarsal Tunnel
Right and Left Sural Findings:
1) Prolonged Right Sural Sensory Peak Latency at 11.5 ms
2) Prolonged Left Sural Sensory Peak Latency at 5.75 ms
These findings are typically encountered in patients with Right and Left Sural Sensory Neuropathy
Right and Left H-Reflex Findings:
1) Prolonged Right H-Reflex Latency at 54.1 ms
2) Unrecordable Left H-Reflex Latency
These findings are typically encountered in patients with Right and Left L5-S1 Radiculopathy
The Electrodiagnostic results in this report are meant to supplement the patient examination and be reviewed by a qualified healthcare provider and are not a
substitute for the professional judgment of the healthcare professional in diagnosing and treating patients. This impression was generated by a computer
analysis and each potential finding identified should be clinically correlated by a qualified healthcare provider. This computer analysis does not imply that all
listed findings are clinically relevant given that some recordings may be deemed a technical artifact and excluded from calculations. The clinical diagnosis can
only be made by the treating physician in the context of the patient's other symptoms and findings.

NERVE CONDUCTION ANALYSIS DETAIL
The findings of this nerve conduction examination suggest the following. Clinical correlation with the
patient's symptoms and examination is indicated to confirm these findings:
1) Left Tarsal Tunnel Posterior Tibial nerve entrapment at the Tarsal Tunnel is a frequent cause of foot, ankle, sole
pain/burning and aching. It is usually worse at night and is seen as a result of trauma and ankle fracture among
others and can be aggravated with joint inflammation from tenosynovitis or phlebitis. Patients experience difficulty
walking because of pain and discomfort with shoes. On exam, there is a positive Tinel sign (tingling upon tapping the
posterior Tibial nerve) behind the medial malleolous. Treatment is symptomatic by relieving the cause and treating
the local trauma and includes foot brace and arch support. Anti-inflammatory medications help and surgery is
indicated in advanced cases.
2) Right and Left Sural Sensory Neuropathy Among others, this can be caused by a peripheral neuropathy.
3) Right and Left L5-S1 Radiculopathy Lumbo-sacral root lesions are most frequent in the L5-S1 distribution, the
intervertebral space between the lumbar and sacral vertebrae. They are typically caused by compression of the
nerve root as it exits the spinal canal and cause a great deal of low back pain with radiation to the affected limb(s)
and loss of reflexes, and weakness. Their onset is usually acute, following an injury, or can come on as an
aggravation of an old back injury. Treatment should address the cause, and in the beginning, consists of an anti-
inflammatory drug regimen and analgesics, accompanied by traction if indicated. When symptoms do not subside
within months or significantly interfere with function, and imaging shows a well defined lesion, surgery is indicated.
The Electrodiagnostic results in this report are meant to supplement the patient examination and be reviewed by a qualified healthcare provider and are not a
substitute for the professional judgment of the healthcare professional in diagnosing and treating patients. This impression was generated by a computer
analysis and each potential finding identified should be clinically correlated by a qualified healthcare provider. This computer analysis does not imply that all

EXAM: DXA HIP AND SPINE
HISTORY: Evaluate osteoporosis, postmenopausal female.
TECHNIQUE: Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry was performed.
COMPARISON: None available.
FINDINGS:
AP Spine AP spine region: {1.136}g/cm2; T-Score {0.8}, Z-Score {1.7}; Normal
Left Femur: Left femur region: {0.836} g/cm2; T-Score {-0.3}, Z-Score {0.5}; Normal
WHO (World Health Organization) Definitions:
Normal: BMD within 1 SD of a "young normal" adult (T-score at -1.0 and above).
Osteopenia: BMD between 1 and 2.5 SD below that of a "young normal" adult (T-score between -1.0 and -2.5).
Osteoporosis: BMD is 2.5 SD or more below that of a "young normal" adult (T-score at or below -2.5).
IMPRESSION:
Normal bone mineral density.
Using the fracture risk algorithm (FRAX),
- the 10 year probability of a major osteoporotic fracture* is: {1.9%}
- the 10 year probability of a hip fracture is: {0.0%}
*Major osteoporotic fracture defined as clinical vertebral, hip, forearm or humerus fracture.
RECOMMENDATION: Medical evaluation for secondary causes of low BMD may be appropriate. All
patients should have an adequate intake of calcium (at least 1200 mg/day) and vitamin D (800-1000
International Units/day). Fracture risk can be reduced by regular weight-bearing and muscle-strengthening
fracture.

Pharmacologic therapies should be considered for postmenopausal women and men age 50 or older who present
with:
- a hip or vertebral fracture
- osteoporosis at the femoral neck or spine after appropriate evaluation to exclude secondary causes
- osteopenia and 10-yr probability of a hip fracture 3% or greater OR at 10-yr probability of a major
osteoporosis-related fracture 20% or greater, based on the US-adapted WHO algorithm.
FOLLOW UP: National Osteoporosis Foundation recommends repeat BMD assessments every two years,
which is in agreement with Medicare guidelines. Testing more frequently may be warranted in certain clinical
situations, such as after initiation or change of therapy or in conditions with rapid bone loss.

Risk of Surgery / Fees
I, Claudia Lorena Barrera Roque understand that there are alternative, non-surgical methods of treatment. However, at this
time, I have decided to proceed with the proposed surgical treatment. I have been advised by my surgeon the proposed surgery may carry
risks, not limited to the following: no improvement; having more pain and discomfort of one or more extremities; having more weakness
or paralysis of one or more muscle groups or limbs temporarily or permanently; loss of bowel and bladder and sexual function; chance of
infections, spinal fluid leak, meningitis, or arachnoiditis; progressive neurological deficits; loss of voice; recurrent disk herniation at the
same level or newly ruptured disk at other levels; instability; need for additional surgical treatment, immediately or remotely from the
time of surgery, approached from the front route or from the back (posterior) or side; major blood loss and injuries to major vessels and
organs requiring additional surgical intervention on an urgent basis; need for blood bank transfusion and its possible complications and
transmission of illness such as viral diseases of the HIV group (AIDS) or hepatitis; possibility of instability and need for bone fusion or
use of instrumentation which increases the duration of the procedure and its complication rate; non-union fusion requiring additional
surgical intervention; hardware breakage or displacement and need for its removal; possible need for use of banked bone and transmission
of related illnesses; harvesting of the patient's iliac crest resulting in chronic local pain at the donor site of the iliac bone; blindness,
cardiopulmonary dysfunction, pulmonary emboli, stroke, anaphylactic shock, cardiac arrest, or even death. All of these above have been
brought to my attention. I also understand that other organ failure and complications can occur in addition to the above possibilities. I also
understand and acknowledge that there are no guarantees provided.
While there are other physicians in the community that may offer similar services, every surgeon's experience, skill level, and expertise
may differ. As such, I have been advised to consider all alternatives at my own discretion and have agreed to the charges set forth above
after considering my options. I have been provided information on ProMedSPINE surgeons and their backgrounds, experience, and
expertise in surgery, and have had discussions directly with my surgeon to answer my questions and concerns. I am advised that
ProMedSPINE charges are set by the practice and are based on multiple factors including, but not limited to, the complexity of the
surgery, the risk of performing the surgery, the skill level and experience of the surgeons, as well as the costs associated with offering the
services to the public
UBR The fee for surgery (for the primary surgeon and his/her assistant) will be itemized for each step of the procedure separately and
billed as an aggregate amount after the surgery is complete.
OR
X
UBR The following outlines the fee for performing the above surgery
$ 60,000.00
for primary surgeon and fifty percent of primary surgeon's fee for the assistant surgeon. I understand that this
fee could increase in the event that there is added complexity, additional steps or levels that may need to be operated on, or other services
that become necessary when the surgeon is in the midst of the procedure.
The above fees for surgery include the fees only for the primary surgeon and his/her assistant. Other third party providers for the facility,
technologists, instrumentation, and other physicians such as anesthesiologists, and others will have separate charges billed by those
parties. Those other third party providers are not a part of ProMedSPINE. Pricing for those services will be provided directly from those
providers to you.
I have been advised and understand that ProMedSPINE, its physicians/staff members, may directly or indirectly be owners or investors in
healthcare products, companies, facilities and services that may be utilized during my care/surgery and agree to proceed being fully
informed of such.

In the course of your treatment, it may be necessary to give you blood or blood products. This form tells you about some of the risks of
receiving blood and about the choices you have.
V UBR
My initials in the box prove I have received the information sheet called "If You Need Blood, You Have
Several Options," published by Corus Blood Services.
Initial
RISKS
Although receiving blood or blood products is a common procedure, it does involve some risks. Some of the risks are listed below.
1. Discomfort or bruising may occur at the site where the blood is given.
2. Minor allergic reactions are common, such as headache, fever, chills, or rash.
3.
Severe reactions can occur, such as difficulty breathing or even death.
. The blood you receive could be contaminated with bacteria which can lead to severe reactions including death.
5. The blood you receive could be contaminated with infectious diseases, such as AIDS or hepatitis.
CHOICES
You may be able to choose where the blood or blood products you receive come from.
A.
Blood from the community blood supply: You can receive blood that has been donated by volunteers to the community blood
bank. This blood has all of the risks described above (See RISKS #1, 2, 3, 4, 5).
B.
Blood from donors you select: Although it has NOT been shown that blood from people you select is any safer than blood from
the community blood supply, you may wish to ask people you know, with your blood type, to donate blood for your use. You may
need to ask several people to donate blood, if you need a lot of blood. If there is not enough blood from donors you select or if their
blood is not useable, you will receive blood from the community blood supply.
C.
Your own blood: Although receiving any blood involves some risks, the safest blood is your own.
. You might be able to donate your own blood or certain parts of your blood before surgery and receive it when you need it.
. Your doctor may have some of the blood you lose during surgery recycled and put back into you.
. Just before surgery, some of your blood could be taken and replaced with other solutions. When you bleed, the lost blood can be
replaced with your own blood.
The advantage of receiving your own blood is that it eliminates the risk of some diseases, such as AIDS or hepatitis. There are still
risks of serious reactions (See RISKS #3 and #4). If there is not enough of your own blood or if your blood is not useable, you will
get blood from donors you have selected or the community blood supply.
Choose one of the following and write your initials in the box next to your choice:
CLBR
I understand that I can delay my surgery in order to donate my own blood. But I DO NOT want to delay my
surgery, and I chose NOT to donate my own blood before surgery.
Initial
I chose to use my own blood if I meet the medical criteria to do so. If there is not enough of my own blood or if
any blood is not usable, I will receive blood from donors I have selected or from the community blood supply.
Initial
My signature below proves that I have received all of the information I want about blood transfusions, about the risks associated with
blood transfusions, and about the available sources of blood. My signature also proves that I agree to receive blood transfusions if
necessary.

History of Present Illness
The patient is being seen in the office with a translator who translates for her to and from
Spanish, word per word. She obtained the imaging studies that we asked for, and she is
here for an in-person physical examination.
Physical Examination
*Inspection: Direct palpation of the posterior aspect of the spine reveals tenderness in
the area of thoracolumbar spine, more towards the right over the facet joints. Palpatio
n of the spine along the midline specifically was notable for severe mid to lower
cervical tenderness and severe lower lumbar spine tenderness.
Palpation of the cervical paravertebral region was significant for tenderness and
spasm noted to be severe bilaterally. Lumbar paravertebral palpation was performed
and was significant for muscle tenderness and spasm noted to be severe bilaterally.
*General: She is oriented to person, place, and time.
The patient's mood appears to be appropriate. The patient was alert.
Cervical Spine Exam: Anterior neck flexion is limited to 30 degrees. Extension of
cervical spine of 10 degrees causes pain in the midline and over the facet joints. Com
ments: Lateral bending to either sides at 10 degrees causes pain radiating down the
arms in what appears to be in the C6 and C7 bilaterally. The patient has a hard time
resisting me during the examination due to neck pain.
*Lumbar Spine: Palpation of the bilateral sacroiliac joint area reveals no pain. The
palpation of the sciatic notch is significant for bilateral tenderness, severe on the left
and mild on the right. Palpation of the greater trochanteric bursa reveals no tenderness. An
terior lumbar flexion is limited to 40 degrees. Lumbar extension is limited to 10
degrees with severe pain and some radiation to the left buttock.
*Neurology - Coordination: Comments: Standing on toes and on heels is difficult on both
sides, but more difficult on the left, and she gets severe back pain doing that.

ICD: Muscle spasm (M62.838)
ICD: Thoracic back pain (M54.6)
ICD: Lumbar back pain (M54.5)
Plan: The patient is a 51-year-old female who was involved in an MVA in April 2019.
Subsequent to that, she suffered injuries, including the Cervical, Thoracic, and Lumbar
Spine. She complains of neck pain and low back pain, but today, she further explained to me
that she has tingling that goes down to her arms from time to time. She also has left-sided
pain in the Lumbar Spine radiating to the left leg in the sciatic distribution.
The patient said that the pain is getting progressively worse as we discussed before.
With regard to the Cervical Spine, the patient has pain at the base of her neck, which is
mechanical in nature. She also had multiple conservative treatments, such as chiropractic
treatment and physical therapy. In addition, she has had some epidural injections in the
Cervical Spine. The last injection was done on 03-09-2021. She said that the result has been
temporary, and at this point, she wants further definitive treatment with regard to her Cervical
Spine.
The Cervical Spine MRI demonstrates disc herniation at C5-6 and C6-7 with foraminal
narrowing. The C5-6 is more affected on the left side. The C6-7 affects bilaterally. These
correlate with the findings on examination. This is concerning her, and at this point, she
wants a definitive treatment. Most likely, she would have a C5-6 and C6-7 anterior cervical
discectomy and disc replacement. However, at this point, she said that her Lumbar Spine is
more severely in pain that limits her quality of life. As such, she would like to address that
first.
We look at the patient's Lumbar Spine, and she appears to have mechanical back pain with
sciatica on the left side where there is pain, numbness, and weakness mostly related to the
L5 nerve root. There is some numbness in the L5 nerve root on the right side as well. She
has a limited range of motion with muscle spasms and evidence of radiculopathy with a
positive straight leg raising, sciatic notch tenderness, weakness, numbness, and pain related
to the left sciatic nerve. The Lumbar Spine MRI, which we obtained demonstrates
anterolisthesis with narrowing at the L4-5 level more on the left than right, correlating with
the findings on examination. She had a lumbar transforaminal epidural injection, but she
does not want to undergo further injections. I did explain to her that she has the option for no
treatment vs. conservative treatment, more physical therapy, chiropractic treatment, pain
management with acute treatment with pain medication and interventional pain
management, and chronic pain management. She also has the option for surgery to address
the misalignment that we saw on the MRI and x-ray in addition to the stenosis. She also has
the option to have a second opinion. We discussed the pros and cons and risks and benefits
of each, and she wants to proceed with Lumbar Spine surgery for definitive treatment given
that she is 51-year-old and wants to have a better quality of life if possible. As such, she
wants to proceed with the surgery.
Therefore, the recommended surgery is an L4-5 ALIF with possible posterior instrumentation
and/or decompression.
The risks and benefits of the ALIF surgery were discussed extensively and the consent
forms were signed. The patient confirms that there were no guarantees given.
The risks include but not limited to infection, bleeding, stroke, coma, death, damage to the
surrounding structures, need for future operations and/or procedures, risk of CSF leak,
paralysis, numbness, incontinence, not resolution or worsening of symptoms, destabilization
of the segment, risk of damage to the spinal cord, nerves and major arteries and vessels,
risk of recurrence. Other unpredictable and unforeseeable risks are understood. Other
alternative options were presented and discussed.
Other risks were discussed such as damage to the surrounding structures including but not
limited to the vessels, lymph nodes, GI track, spleen and liver as well as prostate and
ovaries, kidneys, urether, utters and bladder and other structures, risk of retrograde
ejaculation in males, scar formation, and damage to the vessels supplying the lower
extremities. There are also risks associated with the use of BMP (Bone Morphogenic
Protein) that can cause extra bone formation, inflammation and scar formation, and
increased risk of cancer development. We also discussed risks associated with possible
transfusion such as adverse effects and transmitted infections. Risks of x-ray and
fluoroscopy and radiation are discussed as well as risks associated with pseudoarthrosis and
adjacent level disease.
The patient was given ample amount of time to go over the consent forms, ask questions,
and sign them.
The patient will be clear from a medical standpoint. We will obtain a DEXA bone scan and an
EMG/nerve conduction study for baseline. This may or may not show radiculopathy on the
sampling of the nerves, but she clearly has clinical signs of radiculopathy in addition to
mechanical pain. We will proceed with surgical scheduling. All questions have been
answered.
The Cervical Spine will be addressed later after Lumbar Spine treatment is completed.
The Thoracic Spine MRI did not show any obvious cord compression, but there are some
disc herniations. She also has some pain over the facet joints in the lower Thoracic Spine on
the right side. This will be managed symptomatically until we are done managing her Lumbar
Spine.

CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE AGREEMENT
Patient's Name Claudia Barrera
Pharmacy's Name
Pharmacy's Phone#
Date6/24/2021
. I understand that I am being prescribed narcotic pain medication because other treatments and
medications I have received have not controlled my pain. It is unlikely that any medication will
completely relieve my pain. Controlled substances, including narcotic pain medication, may be
given to me as long as my pain continues, provided I follow the terms of this agreement.
· I understand that these medications will not "cure" my pain.
· (For female patients) I understand that Opiates could be detrimental to a fetus, so I agree to
inform my prescribing physician as soon as I found out I am pregnant.
. I understand that there are possible complications of chronic pain narcotic therapy, including
chemical dependency, addiction, constipation, which could be severe enough to require medical
treatment, difficulty with urination, drowsiness, nausea, itching, depressed respiration, reduced
sexual function, as well as other side effects. If I take more medication than what I am prescribed,
a dangerous situation could result as coma, organ damage, or even death. I understand that if I run
out of my medication too soon, or if my medication is stopped suddenly, I could have narcotic
withdrawal syndromes, which could be uncomfortable or dangerous.
. I understand that the alternative to this kind of medication is to continue using non-habit forming
medications or other types of pain treatment not involving medication, although probably no form
of treatment will ever completely take away my pain.
. Medication may have less effect on the pain on a long term basis, and I understand that narcotics
have less effect on pain when used for an extended period of time. If I am getting absolutely no
help from this medication, or if there are problems, The Treating Physician(s) may need to reduce
or stop my medication. It may be necessary for me to enter into a chemical dependency program
in order to take me completely off the medication.
. A urinary drug screen is medically necessary for new patients and/or indicated follow-up patients
secondary to the possibility of narcotic and/or injection therapy on this visit and/or future visits to
rule out narcotic diversion, assess compliance, and test for illicit substance use/abuse that would
adversely affect the patient's well-being. The Drug Enforcement Agency and the State of
California require constant monitoring as outlined within this Controlled Substance Agreement.
All efforts will be made to charge your insurance company for urine toxicology testing; however,
ultimately the patient is responsible for any and all associated charges. By signing below, you
acknowledge and accept this responsibility.
The following are terms which I agree in order to be prescribed narcotic medications/controlled
substances under the care of The Treating Physician(s). (Please initial each one)

CBOnly The Treating Physician(s)will prescribe these medications for me. I am not allowed to
obtain such medication from any other physician or clinic unless previously discussed with The
Treating Physician(s).
. CBA daily dosage for the medication will be decided by The Treating Physician(s). An
adjustment to the dosage may be done after a reasonable and appropriate interval of time.
Additional changes may be considered depending upon my condition, with The Treating
Physician(s)discretion only. No changes to my dosage will be made by telephone call.
·
CB I will submit the names and dosages of all my medications which I am taking and the names
and telephone numbers of those prescribing physicians.
. CHI am in no way to adjust the dosage of my medication without having discussed it with The
Treating Physician(s).
·
CRI understand if I run out of medication early because I have altered my dosage I will have to
wait until my next scheduled prescription date. Extra medication will not be prescribed if I run
out early.
·
CRI understand that I am to use only one pharmacy. The doctor reserves the right to contact
any pharmacy, insurance company, or physician in order to obtain information in regards to my
care.
·
CP Refill request to be called into the office Monday through Thursday 9 AM to 4 PM with 24
hours advanced notice. No routine refills will be called into pharmacy Monday through Friday
after 4PM, weekends or holidays.
. CKI must return to be seen by The Treating Physician(s)at prescribed intervals as determined
by the physician. If I fail to keep my scheduled appointment, my medication will not be refilled
until I schedule an appointment to be seen by The Treating Physician(s).
. CKI will not arrive at your office unannounced and request prescriptions, changes in
medication, more medication, or to be seen immediately. If I feel my condition is emergent or
life-threatening, I will go to the nearest emergency room.
·
CRI understand that the use of alcohol and illicit drugs are prohibited, and agree to submit to a
drug and alcohol screening upon the request of The Treating Physician(s)at my expense. No
exceptions will be made.
. CK Reported lost or stolen prescriptions will be replaced at the doctor's discretion, with a
$25.00 replacement administration fee.
. CF As a patient under medical management, I understand that I may randomly be called to
bring in my medications and their bottles for a pill count, submit a specimen for drug screening
and/or come to the office for evaluation.
. CB Any altered or forged prescription, obtaining controlled medications from other sources, or
any attempts to sell or give my medications to someone else is unlawful. The Treating
Physician(s)office will cooperate with any regulatory or law enforcement agencies in full if
contacted.
·
CRI will treat the staff with respect, be polite, and present in a non-threatening manner at all
times. I will allow a reasonable amount of time for personal requests to be handled. I will not
show up unexpectedly with requests and/or be verbally abusive to the staff in person or via
telephone conversation.

PHYSICIAN-PATIENT ARBITRATION AGREEMENT
Article 1: Agreement to Arbitrate: It is understood that any dispute as to medical malpractice, that is as
to whether any medical services rendered under this contract were unnecessary or unauthorized or were
improperly, negligently, or incompetently rendered, will be determined by submission to arbitration as
provided by California law, and not by a lawsuit or resort to court process except as California law
provides for judicial review or arbitration proceedings. Both parties to this contract, by entering into it, are
giving up their constitutional rights to have any such dispute decided in a court of law before a jury, and
instead, are accepting the use of arbitration.
Article 2: All Claims Must be Arbitrated: The parties intend that this agreement binds all parties whose
claims may arise out of or related to treatment or service provided by the physician, including any spouse
or heirs of the patient and any children, whether born or unborn, at the time of the occurrence, giving rise
to any claim. In the case of any pregnant mother, the term "patient" herein shall mean the mother and the
mother's expected child or children. All claims for monetary damages exceeding the jurisdictional limit of
the small claims court against the physician, and the physician's partners, associates, association,
corporation or partnership, and the employees, agents, and estates of any of them, must be arbitrated
including, without limitation, claims for loss of consortium, wrongful death, emotional distress or
punitive damages. The filing of any court by the physician to collect any fee from the patient shall not
waive the right to compel arbitration of any malpractice claim.
Article 3: Procedures and Applicable Law: A demand for arbitration must communicate in writing to
all parties. Each party shall select an arbitrator (party arbitrator) within thirty days, and a third arbitrator
(neutral arbitrator) shall be selected by the arbitrators appointed by the parties within thirty days of a
demand for a neutral arbitrator by either party. Each party to the arbitration shall pay such party's pro rata
share of the expenses and fees of the neutral arbitrator, together with other expenses of the arbitration
incurred or approved by the neutral arbitrator, not including counsel fees or witness fees, or other
expenses incurred by a party for such party's own benefit. The parties agree that the arbitrators have the
immunity of a judicial officer from civil liability when acting in the capacity of the arbitrator under this
contract. This immunity shall supplement, not supplant, any other applicable statutory or common law.
Either party shall have the absolute right to arbitrate separately the issues of liability and damages upon
written request to the neutral arbitrator. The parties consent to the intervention and joinder in this
arbitration of any person or entity, which would otherwise be a proper additional party in a court action,
and upon such intervention and joinder, any existing court action against such additional person or entity
shall be stayed pending arbitration. The parties agree that provisions of California law applicable to health
care providers shall apply to disputes within this arbitration agreement, including, but not limited to, Code
of Civil Procedure Section 340.5 and 667.7 and Civil Code Sections 3333.1 and 3333.2. Any party may
bring before the arbitrations a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication in accordance with
the Code of Civil Procedure. Discovery shall be conducted pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
1283.05; however, depositions may be taken without prior approval of the neutral arbitrator.
Article 4: General Provisions: All claims based upon the same incident, transaction, or related
circumstances shall be arbitrated in one proceeding. A claim shall be waived and forever barred if: (1) on
the date the notice thereof is received, the claim, if asserted in a civil action, would be barred by the
applicable California statute of limitations, or (2) the claimant fails to pursue the arbitration claim in
accordance with the procedures prescribed herein with reasonable diligence. With respect to any matter

not herein expressly provided for, the arbitrators shall be governed by the California Code of Civil
Procedure provisions relating to arbitration.
Article 5: Revocation: This agreement may be revoked by written notice delivered to the physician
within 30 days, or signature. It is the intent of this agreement to apply to all medical services rendered any
time for any condition.
Article 6: Retroactive Effect: If the patient intends this agreement to cover services rendered before the
date, it is Effective as of the date of first medical services.
PATIENT'S INITIALS [or Parent, Guardian, or Legal Representative]
If any provision of this arbitration agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions
shall remain in full force and shall not be affected by the invalidity of any other provision.

acknowledge that I have received a copy.

PATIENT RESPONSIBILITIES, SHARING RECORDS & FEES
I hereby assign all benefits and payments for medical services rendered to me, to be paid directly to The
Treating Physician(s). I understand that I am responsible for all charges incurred by myself, regardless of
insurance coverage. I understand that if the insurance company sends such payments for services rendered
to me, I am responsible for forwarding that amount IN FULL and any other amounts due to The Treating
Physician(s). I acknowledge that Medical Doctors are licensed and regulated by the Medical Board of
California (800) 633-2322. All amounts agreed to below are in addition to any and all insurance
payments. Should insurance payments be made payable to me, regardless of my having paid a co-pay
previously, I agree to forward that amount IN FULL to The Treating Physician(s), within 15 calendar
days. Failure to do so will result in my being responsible for the whole amount billed by The Treating
Physician(s). Additionally, I will be responsible for all fees associated with the collection.
The Treating Physician(s), and its staff, and/or employees, and/or contracted staff (collectively hereon
called "Person"), may have relationships that may or may not include Person owning a share, equity,
and/or other various forms of revenue-sharing programs with entities that The Treating Physician(s)
associates with and/or utilizes throughout a care and/or treatment of a patient without limitation. This may
include, surgery centers, medical distribution companies, DME product sales and distributions, insurance
companies, HMO companies, and/or medical supplier sales and distribution companies (collectively
hereon called "Person-Owned Entity" & "POE"). You, the patient, acknowledge, realize, and agree that
this will not play a role in your care and/or treatment, and hold Person free of all liabilities associated with
POE, regardless of if any of the POE is utilized throughout your volunteer care from The Treating
Physician(s).
I have MediCARE only as my insurance or I have MediCARE as primary and MediCAL or Private
Insurance without an Out-Of-Network Benefit as second insurance. By signing this document, I
acknowledge that The Treating Physician(s) is not a contracted provider of MediCAL and/or he is out of
network, and therefore does not accept Medical or my private insurance as my secondary insurance. I
acknowledge that I am responsible for 20% of MediCARE allowable, and that any and all payments due
for all consultations and visits will be due at the end of the visit. I understand that surgery fees will be due
prior to surgery. I understand and agree that any under and/or over-payment will be billed and/or credited
to my account, respectively. I agree that I will do my very best to pay the remaining balance. I also
understand that there may be a refund at the conclusion of my treatment with The Treating Physician(s) if,
in fact, there has been any overpayment note; a supplemental Private Insurance with an Out-Of-Network
Benefit covers the 20%.
Or, I have Private Insurance (such as Blue Cross, Blue Shields, Cigna, United Healthcare, etc.) as my
primary and only insurance plan. By choice, I have decided on consult(s) and/or procedures by The
Treating Physician(s), knowing that The Treating Physician(s) is an out-of-network healthcare provider.
Based on my deductible, maximum out of pocket amounts, insurance maximums, and percent covered by
my insurance, I agree to the following fee schedule.
Or, I have MediCAL as a primary insurance. By signing this document, I acknowledge that The Treating
Physician(s) is not a contracted provider of MediCAL, and therefore does not accept this insurance. I

acknowledge that I am responsible for any and all payments due for services rendered. This includes
100% of any and all usual and customary doctor's fees, and the yearly deductibles. I understand and agree
that fees are to be paid in advance of all consultations and procedures.
English: My finances are such that if I was forced to pay the full fee that The Treating Physician(s) is
entitled to for rendering services, I would have no choice NOT to receive the necessary medical care
required for my well-being. I have requested, and it has been accepted by the staff, that The Treating
Physician(s)'s fees be adjusted to accommodate my limited financial living budget.
Spanish: Mis finanzas son tales que si me vi obligado a pagar la tarifa completa que el The Treating

médica necesaria necesaria para mi bienestar. He solicitado, y ha sido aceptado por el personal. Que los
honorarios del The Treating Physician(s) de ser ajustado para acomodar mi presupuesto limitado.
I am responsible for keeping an appointment. The Treating Physician(s) and/or his staff are not in any
way, shape, or form to be held responsible for my missing of any appointments.
I am responsible for getting any and all tests and/or orders given to me. The Treating Physician(s) and/or
his staff are not in any shape or form to be held responsible for my not getting those tests/orders
completed. It is also my responsibility that, once the tests/orders are completed, I make/keep an
appointment with The Treating Physician(s) to review and go over the results and/or possible treatment
options.
I am responsible for any and all approvals by my insurance carrier for all orders/tests recommended to me
by The Treating Physician(s). It is my responsibility to get approval from my Insurance carrier and/or
decide to pay cash for my tests/orders.
I am responsible for obtaining an interpreter should I require one of us to effectively communicate with
The Treating Physician(s) regarding my care. If I cannot find/obtain one, I can request The Treating
Physician(s)'s office to try and find me a professional interpreter, and I will be responsible for the full
amount charged by the interpreter. I also understand that I have a choice of bringing a friend and/or a
family member to stand as an interpreter for me.
I am responsible for taking all steps and measures to ensure I receive proper health care. I understand and
agree that I am considered "discharged" from the care of The Treating Physician(s) if I miss my
appointment, my treatment is completed, and/or if I have not seen The Treating Physician(s) for 12
consecutive months. It is solely my responsibility, and I am completely liable to obtain and keep my
appointments with all of the necessary doctors, to obtain any and all tests/orders recommended for my
care by any and all of my doctors. Additionally, my doctor(s) have the right to terminate my care due to
non-compliance, non-payment, and/or unacceptable behavior.
Furthermore, I agree and understand that I am personally responsible for medical services and associated
medical bills. As such, I agree to give physicians of ProMedSPINE information concerning any and all
insurance policies and other payment sources which may cover some of the said medical treatment and
hereby assign to Physician the benefits therein. I further agree to notify physicians of ProMedSPINE, and
pay their bills at such time as I may personally receive payments made directly to myself for these

services, from any third party. I do hereby waive and fully give up my right to claim that debts are not
collectible by any reason of any applicable statute of limitations, or any other penalties caused by this
delay at my request. In other words, I am giving up the right to use as an affirmative defense any statute
of limitations or laches, or dismissal for delay, which I may have had a right to use, for a period of ten
(10) years, form the date I place my signature upon this document.
While there are other physicians in the community that may offer similar services, every surgeon's
(physician's) experience, skill level, and expertise may differ. As such, I have been advised to consider all
alternatives at my own discretion and have agreed to the charges set forth by ProMedSPINE after
considering my options. I have been provided with and have access to information on ProMedSPINE
surgeons and doctors and their backgrounds, experience, and expertise in surgery, and have had
opportunity to obtain answers to my questions and concerns. I am advised that ProMedSPINE charges are
set by the practice and are based on multiple factors including, but not limited to, the complexity of
medical issues and diagnosis, the risk of performing the surgery and procedures, the skill level and
experience of the physicians, as well as the costs associated with offering the services to the public. I
agree to all the fees (fee schedule available upon request). The fee for initial Neurosurgical evaluation is
$1250 and each follow up visit is $850. The fee for initial Pain Management evaluation is $900 and each
follow up visit is $500. The fee for evaluation of each X-ray is $150 and any other imaging is $220. The
fee for injections is $6250 and rhizatomies or ablations are $15,000. ProMedSPINE rates are subject to
change without any further notice. Other procedures will be billed separately. The above fees for surgery
include the fees only for ProMedSPINE doctors. Other third party providers for the facility, technicians,
instrumentation, and other physicians such as anesthesiologists, and others will have separate charges
billed by those parties. Those other third party providers are not a part of ProMedSPINE. Pricing for
those services will be provided directly from those providers to you.
This agreement may not be altered, modified, revoked, or compromised in any way without approval of
physicians of ProMedSPINE and shall remain in force and effect at all times until all monies due have
been paid. If legal action is necessary to enforce this Agreement, then the prevailing party shall recover
reasonable attorney fees and costs. I am waiving certain rights including the right to claim Statute of
Limitation, Laches, other penalties caused by delay as an affirmative defense.
I have been advised and understand that ProMedSPINE, its physicians/staff members, may directly or
indirectly be owners or investors in healthcare products, companies, facilities and services that may be
utilized during my care/surgery and agree to proceed being fully informed of such.
Hereby, I authorize physicians of ProMedSPINE to share my medical records on their password and
captcha protected online portal. I also understand that this portal is only accessible with the username and
password.

ICD: Lumbar back pain (M54.5)
Plan: The patient is a 51-year-old female who was involved in an incident. After which, she
suffered injuries, including cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine pain that have been treated
conservatively with injections. However, she continues to have symptoms, and as such, she
is seeking further evaluation.
The patient explained to me on the video that she has pain to the left of the midline in her
lower back that radiates down to the left leg in what appears to be in the sciatic distribution.
She also has some mid-thoracic and some cervical pain. The cervical pain is also causing
some left-sided neck pain and some left arm discomfort.
The imaging studies that the patient had were from 2019. I reviewed her records, and at this
point, she would need to have new and updated imaging studies, which I ordered today. She
will come to the office for an in-person evaluation and physical examination to assess and
provide her with appropriate treatment options available to her. All questions have been
answered.

Account #: 636
Date of Service: 03/09/2021
Date of Birth: 10/19/1969 (51)
Procedure: C7-T1 Interlaminar Epidural Steroid Injection
with Cephalad Spread under Fluoroscopic Guidance
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Cervical Discogenic/Radicular Pain.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same.
PROCEDURE:
1.
C7-T1 interlaminar epidural steroid injection under fluoroscopic guidance.
2.
C7-T1 Epidurogram.
ANESTHESIA: MAC (with general backup)
ASA: 1
COMPLICATIONS: None
CONSENT: Informed consent was obtained prior to the procedure. The patient was given the opportunity to ask
questions regarding the procedure and its associated risks. The patient was informed that with any injection
procedure there is a risk of bleeding. If a bleeding complication does occur, however, it is unlikely (less than 1%
chance) that a transfusion of blood products would be necessary. The patient was informed of the potential for
nerve root injury, which can lead to permanent pain and/or weakness, and laceration of the spinal dura, which can
lead to prolonged spinal headaches. The patient was aware that infections can occur after injection procedures.
If an infection does occur it may require hospitalization and potentially surgery, and could lead to epidural abscess
with paralysis or even death. The patient understands that some patients will have a severe flare-up in their pain
for 1-2 weeks after an injection procedure. In some individuals this increase in pain can last longer, or in rare
cases even be permanent. Additionally, the patient understands that we may be injecting a variety of substances
into the spine for diagnostic and/or therapeutic purposes. These substances include, but are not limited to, local
anesthetics, corticosteroids, contrast agents, and a antibiotics. Although unusual, adverse reactions to these
medications can occur, including allergic reactions and temporary seizures. If corticosteroids are used there is a
risk of increased blood sugar (hyperglycemia) and aseptic necrosis of the hip.
In addition to other risks, the patient was informed of the risks of conscious sedation, which include allergic
reactions to medications, as well as the potential for over sedation with loss of protective reflexes, potential
breathing problems, lack of blood flow to the brain or other vital organs such as the heart, which creates the risk
for a major complication such as stroke, heart attack or potentially even death.
PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION:
The patient has been explained about risks and benefits with procedure and wishes to continue.

Barrera Roque, Claudia L, 636, Female, DOB: 10/19/1969 (51) , DOS: 03/09/2021
The patient was taken to the operating room and positioned prone over the table. The neck and upper back was
prepped and draped in sterile fashion.
The patient was monitored continuously throughout the procedure using cardiopulmonary monitoring pulse
oximetry and automatic blood pressure. The patient was under the supervision of and was monitored by the
surgeon at all times during the procedure.
Under fluoroscopic guidance, the C7-T1 interspace was identified. Local anesthetic was given using 1% lidocaine.
An 20-gauge 3.5-inch Tuohy needle was inserted under fluoroscopy and touched down to the lamina. The needle
was withdraw slightly and redirected to the C7-T1 interspace, and the epidural space was entered using loss of
resistance technique. Omnipaque-240 contrast dye was injected into the area outlining the epidurogram. There
was no evidence of epidural adhesions. A solution of 16mg Dexamethasone and 1ml of preservative free normal
saline was injected into the epidural space, completing the C7-T1 interlaminar epidural injection under
fluoroscopic guidance.
The patient was taken to the recovery room in stable condition. The patient tolerated the procedure well without
complications. The patient was advised to observe for signs of cauda equina syndrome, in which case, the patient
is to call me immediately. The patient was discharged according to protocol.
ROGRAM
RADIOLOGIC INTERPRETATION OF EPIDUROGRAM
EPIDUROGRAM:
Epidurogram was performed at C7-T1 . At each level, 1ml of Omnipaque-240 contrast dye was injected. There
was free flowing of contrast dye into the epidural space without evidence of blockage. There was no evidence of
epidural adhesion. There was no intravascular uptake or enhancement noted.

MRI of Cervical and thoracic Spine was reviewed previously in detail and with patient.
Report and pathology as above. All questions about imaging answered.
Reports 50% improvement, with associated increased ease with ADLs, status post C7-
T1 interlaminar epidural steroid injection under fluoroscopic guidance 04/09/20. However
no additional improvement with second epiudral injection and benefits from first injection
wearing off.
Previous ONB had only mild benefits for a few days.
Recommend 8 additional sessions of PT
Future consideration may include trigger point, joint, or spinal injection based on progress
with conservative care and imaging review. May employ judicious use of medication
management as needed for symptom control. Adjunct therapies such as acupuncture or
electric stimulation might also be of benefit in this case. Follow up after above for review
and re-assessment.

injection under fluoroscopic guidance 04/09/20. However no additional improvement with second epiudral injection
and benefits from first injection wearing off.
Proceed with left occipital nerve block
We discussed in detail the risks of steroid injections especially with COVID pandmeic and possible decreased
immunity. Patient reports is willing to take risks and want proceed with injections. Reports that pain is bad enough
that procedure "does not feel elective" and wishs to proceed ,
Future consideration may include trigger point, joint, or spinal injection based on progress with conservative care and
imaging review. May employ judicious use of medication management as needed for symptom control. Adjunct
therapies such as acupuncture or electric stimulation might also be of benefit in this case.May also consider surgical
referral

Notes:
Patient acknowledges and is agreeable to current treatment plan.
Procedures:
After discussing benefits and possible side effects, informed consent was obtained to proceed with
bilateral occipital nerve blocks injection(s) targeting the left greater and less occipital nerves. Using
aseptic technique, a total of 1cc of 0.5% bupivacine mixed with 10 mg of Kenalog was injected into the
lesser and greather occipital nerve on each side. Aspiration revealed no blood or other fluid. The patient
tolerated the procedure well without adverse effects. The patient experienced substantial pain relief
immediately after procedure. Patient was instructed on post procedure care, including extreme caution
while driving for 8 hours and to be aware of potential dizziness.

OPERATIVE REPORT
PATIENT: Barrera Roque, Claudia
DOB: 10/19/1969
PROCEDURE DATE: Thursday, April 9, 2020
SURGEON: Sloane Yu, MD
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Cervical Discogenic/Radicular Pain.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same.
PROCEDURE:
1.
C7-T1 interlaminar epidural steroid injection under fluoroscopic guidance.
2.
C7-T1 Epidurogram.
ANESTHESIA:
MAC.
N/A
ANESTHESIA TIME: 10 minutes.
CONSENT: Informed consent was obtained prior to the procedure. The patient was given the opportunity to ask
questions regarding the procedure and its associated risks. The patient was informed that with any injection procedure
there is a risk of bleeding. If a bleeding complication does occur, however, it is unlikely (less than 1% chance) that a
transfusion of blood products would be necessary. The patient was informed of the potential for nerve root injury,
which can lead to permanent pain and/or weakness, and laceration of the spinal dura, which can lead to prolonged
spinal headaches. The patient was aware that infections can occur after injection procedures. If an infection does
occur it will require hospitalization and potentially surgery, and could lead to epidural abscess with paralysis or even
death. The patient was informed that an antibiotic would be added to the contrast injected into the discs, in an effort to
avoid infection. The patient understands that some patients will have a severe flare-up in their pain for 1-2 weeks after
an injection procedure. In some individuals this increase in pain can last longer, or in rare cases even be permanent.
Additionally, the patient understands that we may be injecting a variety of substances into the spine for diagnostic and/or
therapeutic purposes. These substances include, but are not limited to, local anesthetics, corticosteroids, contrast
agents, and a antibiotics. Although unusual, adverse reactions to these medications can occur, including allergic

4/10/2020
Cloud EMR - nbilling_2020-04-09 Trinity Interlaminar Cervical ESI^2313
reactions and temporary seizures. If corticosteroids are used there is a risk of increased blood sugar (hyperglycemia)
and aseptic necrosis of the hip.
In addition to other risks, the patient was informed of the risks of conscious sedation, which include allergic reactions to
medications, as well as the potential for over sedation with loss of protective reflexes, potential breathing problems, lack
of blood flow to the brain or other vital organs such as the heart, which creates the risk for a major complication such
as stroke, heart attack or potentially even death.
PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION:
The patient has been explained about risks and benefits with procedure and wishes to continue. The patient was taken
to the operating room and positioned prone over the table. The back was prepped and draped in sterile fashion.
The patient was monitored continuously throughout the procedure using cardiopulmonary monitoring pulse oximetry and
automatic blood pressure. The patient was under the supervision of and was monitored by the surgeon at all times
during the procedure.
Under fluoroscopic guidance, the C7-T1 interspace was identified. Local anesthetic was given using 1% lidocaine. An
18-gauge 3.5 inch Tuohy needle was inserted under fluoroscopy and touched down to the lamina. The needle was
withdraw slightly and redirected to the C7-T1 interspace, and the epidural space was entered using loss of resistance
technique. Isoview 300 contrast dye was injected into the area outlining the epidurogram. There was no evidence of
epidural adhesions. A solution of A solution of 8mg Dexamethasone and 1 cc of preservative free normal saline was
injected into the epidural space, completing the C7-T1 interlaminar epidural injection under fluoroscopic guidance. and 1
cc of preservative free normal saline was injected into the epidural space, completing the C7-T1 interlaminar epidural
injection under fluoroscopic guidance.
The patient was taken to the recovery room in stable condition. The patient tolerated the procedure well without
complications. The patient was advised to observe for signs of cauda equina syndrome, in which case, the patient is to
call me immediately. The patient was discharged according to protocol.

Notes: Has finished Chirpractic, Physical therapy and acupuncture and is still symptomatic
MRI of Cervical and thoracic Spine was reviewed previously in detail and with patient. Report
and pathology as above. All questions about imaging answered.
Based on history, physical exam, diagnostic data, and clinical trajectory, I propose to proceed
with a C7-T1 interlaminar epidural steroid injection under fluoroscopic guidance, with cephalad spread
of injectant. Risks and benefits of the procedure/injection have been discussed with the patient.
Patient understood the risks of the procedure/injection including but not limited to bleeding, infection,
nerve injury, increased pain, possible side effects associated with injectant(s) used, and in very rare
instances, paralysis, stroke, and death. Informed consent obtained.
Future consideration may include trigger point, joint, or spinal injection based on progress with
conservative care and imaging review. May employ judicious use of medication management as
needed for symptom control. Adjunct therapies such as acupuncture or electric stimulation might also
be of benefit in this case. May also consider surgical referral.

Notes: Recommend continue physiotherapy services for increasing functional range of motion and
reduction of muscular spasms, along with therapeutic treatment modalities for pain reduction.
MRI of Cervical and thoracic Spine was reviewed previously in detail and with patient. Report
and pathology as above. All questions about imaging answered.
For left sided neck pain and stiffness radiating to the left arm, PT and accupuncture has been
helpful for conservativley managing symptoms. However, they remain persistent. Will refer for
additional accupuncture and physical therapy treatment. If still persistent or residual symptoms, will
request surgical consultation.
Future consideration may include trigger point, joint, or spinal injection based on progress with
conservative care and imaging review. May employ judicious use of medication management as
needed for symptom control. Adjunct therapies such as acupuncture or electric stimulation might also
be of benefit in this case. Follow up after above for review and re-assessment.

helpful for conservativley managing symptoms. However, they remain persistent. Will refer for
additional accupuncture and physical therapy treatment. If still persistent or residual symptoms, will
request surgical consultation.
Future consideration may include trigger point, joint, or spinal injection based on progress with
conservative care and imaging review. May employ judicious use of medication management as
needed for symptom control. Adjunct therapies such as acupuncture or electric stimulation might also
be of benefit in this case. Follow up after above for review and re-assessment.

Notes: Recommend continue physiotherapy services for increasing functional range of motion and
reduction of muscular spasms, along with therapeutic treatment modalities for pain reduction.
MRI of Cervical and thoracic Spine was reviewed previously in detail and with patient. Report
and pathology as above. All questions about imaging answered.
Severe neck pain flare, highly unlikely to be related to Thoracic ESI (where symptoms have
actually improved). No red flags or signs of infection. Administered 60mg IM Toradol injection today
for severe pain. Denies renal/GI issues and advised to hold Meloxicam after injection. Advised to
continue as needed.
Future consideration may include trigger point, joint, or spinal injection based on progress with
conservative care and imaging review. May employ judicious use of medication management as
needed for symptom control. Adjunct therapies such as acupuncture or electric stimulation might also
be of benefit in this case. Follow up after above for review and re-assessment.
To optimize pain care, continue on mobic (for anti-inflammatory effect). To help manage flare,
will refer for trial of accupuncture therapy.

actually improved). No red flags or signs of infection. Administered 60mg IM Toradol injection today
for severe pain. Denies renal/GI issues and advised to hold Meloxicam after injection. Advised to
continue as needed.
Future consideration may include trigger point, joint, or spinal injection based on progress with
conservative care and imaging review. May employ judicious use of medication management as
needed for symptom control. Adjunct therapies such as acupuncture or electric stimulation might also
be of benefit in this case. Follow up after above for review and re-assessment.
To optimize pain care, continue on mobic (for anti-inflammatory effect). To help manage flare,
will refer for trial of accupuncture therapy.

Notes: Recommend continue physiotherapy services for increasing functional range of motion and
reduction of muscular spasms, along with therapeutic treatment modalities for pain reduction.
MRI of Cervical and thoracic Spine was reviewed previously in detail and with patient. Report
and pathology as above. All questions about imaging answered.
For left sided neck pain and stiffness radiating to the left arm, PT and accupuncture has been
helpful for conservativley managing symptoms. However, they remain persistent. Will refer for
additional accupuncture and physical therapy treatment. If still persistent or residual symptoms, will
request surgical consultation.
Future consideration may include trigger point, joint, or spinal injection based on progress with
conservative care and imaging review. May employ judicious use of medication management as
needed for symptom control. Adjunct therapies such as acupuncture or electric stimulation might also
be of benefit in this case. Follow up after above for review and re-assessment.

For left sided neck pain and stiffness radiating to the left arm, will recommend PT for the
cervical spine x 6 sessions.
Future consideration may include trigger point, joint, or spinal injection based on progress with
conservative care and imaging review. May employ judicious use of medication management as
needed for symptom control. Adjunct therapies such as acupuncture or electric stimulation might also
be of benefit in this case. Follow up after above for review and re-assessment.
To optimize pain care, continue on mobic (for anti-inflammatory effect). To help manage flare,
will refer for trial of accupuncture therapy.

Severe neck pain flare, highly unlikely to be related to Thoracic ESI (where symptoms have
actually improved). No red flags or signs of infection. Administered 60mg IM Toradol injection today
for severe pain. Denies renal/GI issues and advised to hold Meloxicam after injection. Advised to
continue as needed.
Future consideration may include trigger point, joint, or spinal injection based on progress with
conservative care and imaging review. May employ judicious use of medication management as
needed for symptom control. Adjunct therapies such as acupuncture or electric stimulation might also
be of benefit in this case. Follow up after above for review and re-assessment.
To optimize pain care, continue on mobic (for anti-inflammatory effect). To help manage flare,
will refer for trial of accupuncture therapy.
Referral To: Pending Services

OPERATIVE REPORT
PATIENT: Barrera Roque, Claudia
DOB: 10/19/1969
PROCEDURE DATE: Tuesday, August 13, 2019
SURGEON: Sloane Yu MD
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Thoracic Discogenic Pain.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same.
PROCEDURE:
1.
Right T8 transforaminal epidural steroid injection under fluoroscopic guidance.
2.
Right T9 transforaminal epidural steroid injection under fluoroscopic guidance.
3.
Right T8 and Right T9 Epidurogram.
ANESTHESIA:
MAC.
ANESTHESIA TIME: 10 minutes.
CONSENT: Informed consent was obtained prior to the procedure. The patient was given the
opportunity to ask questions regarding the procedure and its associated risks. The patient was informed
that with any injection procedure there is a risk of bleeding. If a bleeding complication does occur,
however, it is unlikely (less than 1% chance) that a transfusion of blood products would be necessary.
The patient was informed of the potential for nerve root injury, which can lead to permanent pain and/or
weakness, and laceration of the spinal dura, which can lead to prolonged spinal headaches, as well as the
risk of pneumothorax or lung puncture which will require an insertion of a chest tube and hospitalization.
The patient was aware that infections can occur after injection procedures. If an infection does occur it
will require hospitalization and potentially surgery, and could lead to epidural abscess with paralysis or
even death. The patient was informed that an antibiotic would be added to the contrast injected into the
discs, in an effort to avoid infection. The patient understands that some patients will have a severe
flare-up in their pain for 1-2 weeks after an injection procedure. In some individuals this increase in pain
can last longer, or in rare cases even be permanent. Additionally, the patient understands that we may be
injecting a variety of substances into the spine for diagnostic and/or therapeutic purposes. These
substances include, but are not limited to, local anesthetics, corticosteroids, contrast agents, and a
antibiotics. Although unusual, adverse reactions to these medications can occur, including allergic
reactions and temporary seizures. If corticosteroids are used there is a risk of increased blood sugar
(hyperglycemia) and aseptic necrosis of the hip.
In addition to other risks, the patient was informed of the risks of conscious sedation, which include
allergic reactions to medications, as well as the potential for over sedation with loss of protective reflexes,
potential breathing problems, lack of blood flow to the brain or other vital organs such as the heart, which
creates the risk for a major complication such as stroke, heart attack or potentially even death.
PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION:
The patient has been explained about risks and benefits with procedure and wishes to continue. The
patient was taken to the operating room and positioned prone over the table. The back was prepped and
draped in sterile fashion.
The patient was given MAC. of Versed through the previous established IV for sedation. The patient was
monitored continuously throughout the procedure using cardiopulmonary monitoring pulse oximetry and
automatic blood pressure. The patient was under the supervision of and was monitored by the surgeon at
all times during the procedure.
The area of maximum pain was identified under fluoroscopic and correlated to the right T8 and T9 areas
of the thoracic spine
Under fluoroscopic guidance, the Right T8 vertebra rib was located by counting from the 12th rib. Local
anesthetic was given using 1% lidocaine. A 25-gauge 3.5 inch Quincke needle was inserted under
fluoroscopy and positioned at 6 o'clock position of the Right T8 pedicle. Lateral view was checked to
with the needle positioned in the superior aspect of the foramen. In the AP view, Isoview 300 contrast dye
was injected into the area outlining the epidurogram. There was no evidence of epidural adhesions. A
solution of 4mg Dexamethasone and 1/2 cc of 1% preservative free lidocaine was injected to the area
completing the Right T8 transforaminal epidural injection under fluoroscopic guidance.
Under fluoroscopic guidance, the Right T9 vertebra rib was located by counting from the 12th rib. Local
anesthetic was given using 1% lidocaine. A 25-gauge 3.5 inch Quincke needle was inserted under
fluoroscopy and positioned at 6 o'clock position of the Right T9 pedicle. Lateral view was checked to
with the needle positioned in the superior aspect of the foramen. In the AP view, Isoview 300 contrast dye
was injected into the area outlining the epidurogram. There was no evidence of epidural adhesions. A
solution of 4mg Dexamethasone and 1/2 cc of 1% preservative free lidocaine was injected to the area
completing the Right T9 transforaminal epidural injection under fluoroscopic guidance.
The patient was taken to the recovery room in stable condition. The patient tolerated the procedure well
without complications. The patient was advised to observe for signs of cauda equina syndrome, in which
case, the patient is to call me immediately. The patient was discharged according to protocol.

DOS: 07/25/2019
Based on patient history, physical exam, diagnostic data, and clinical trajectory, I propose to
proceed with right T6 and T7 (exact levels to be determined under fluoroscopy) transforaminal epidural
steroid injections under fluoroscopic guidance. These injections would be diagnostic as well as
therapeutic. INFORMED CONSENT Risks and benefits of the procedure/injection have been discussed
with the patient. Patient understood the risks of the procedure/injection including but not limited to
bleeding, infection, nerve injury, increased pain, rare side effects associated with injectant(s) used,
and in the case of spinal intervention (where applicable), potentially also paralysis, stroke, and death.
Informed consent obtained.,
Future consideration may include trigger point, joint, or spinal injection based on progress with
conservative care and imaging review. May employ judicious use of medication management as
needed for symptom control. Adjunct therapies such as acupuncture or electric stimulation might also
be of benefit in this case. Follow up after above for review and re-assessment. ,
To optimize pain care, continue on mobic (for anti-inflammatory effect), flexeril (for muscle
relaxation).

Notes: Patient was given mental health screeners to assess current
symptomology and to determine and monitor change. Results are
documented above, and reviewed as follows: Patient Health
Questionnaire (PHQ-9) The PHQ-9 is a nine item self-report
questionnaire, which measures depression. The PHQ-9 is used in
assisting primary care clinicians in diagnosing depression, as well as
selecting and monitoring treatment. It assesses depressive
symptoms, providing a severity score to help select and monitor
treatment. Patient scored (0-27) on the PHQ-9, out of a max of 27.
This is indicative of MODERATELY SEVERE mood symptoms.
General Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7). The GAD-7 is a seven item self-
report questionnaire, which measures the severity of General
Anxiety Disorder, but is a gross measure for anxiety symptoms
overall. The GAD-7 is used in assisting clinicians in diagnosing
anxiety by providing a severity score to help select and monitor
treatment. Patient scored (0-21) on the GAD-7, out of a maximum of
21. This is indicative of MODERATELY SEVERE anxiety symptoms.

Notes: Recommend INITIATE/CONTINUE
chiropractic/physiotherapy services for increasing functional range
of motion and reduction of muscular spasms, along with therapeutic
treatment modalities for pain reduction.
Depending on progress with conservative care and ongoing
symptomatology, MRI imaging will/may be helpful in this case to
provide further objective evidence of underlying pathology and guide
additional treatment options. Future consideration may include
trigger point, joint, or spinal injection based on progress with
conservative care and imaging review. May employ judicious use of
medication management as needed for symptom control. Adjunct
therapies such as acupuncture or electric stimulation might also be
of benefit in this case. Follow up after above for review and re-
assessment. ,
To optimize pain care, we will start patient on mobic (for anti-
inflammatory effect), flexeril (for muscle relaxation).
Notes: Patient was given mental health screeners to assess current
2. Others
symptomology and to determine and monitor change. Results are
documented above, and reviewed as follows: Patient Health
Questionnaire (PHQ-9) The PHQ-9 is a nine item self-report
questionnaire, which measures depression. The PHQ-9 is used in
assisting primary care clinicians in diagnosing depression, as well as
selecting and monitoring treatment. It assesses depressive
symptoms, providing a severity score to help select and monitor
treatment. Patient scored (0-27) on the PHQ-9, out of a max of 27.
This is indicative of MODERATELY SEVERE mood symptoms.
General Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7). The GAD-7 is a seven item self-
report questionnaire, which measures the severity of General
Anxiety Disorder, but is a gross measure for anxiety symptoms
overall. The GAD-7 is used in assisting clinicians in diagnosing
anxiety by providing a severity score to help select and monitor
treatment. Patient scored (0-21) on the GAD-7, out of a maximum of
21. This is indicative of MODERATELY SEVERE anxiety symptoms.

Notes: Recommend INITIATE/CONTINUE
chiropractic/physiotherapy services for increasing functional range
of motion and reduction of muscular spasms, along with therapeutic
treatment modalities for pain reduction.
Depending on progress with conservative care and ongoing
symptomatology, MRI imaging will/may be helpful in this case to
provide further objective evidence of underlying pathology and guide
additional treatment options. Future consideration may include
trigger point, joint, or spinal injection based on progress with
conservative care and imaging review. May employ judicious use of
medication management as needed for symptom control. Adjunct
therapies such as acupuncture or electric stimulation might also be
of benefit in this case. Follow up after above for review and re-
assessment. ,
To optimize pain care, we will start patient on mobic (for anti-
inflammatory effect), flexeril (for muscle relaxation).
