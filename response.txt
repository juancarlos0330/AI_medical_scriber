She complained of persistent/worsening symptoms since onset. Experienced constant/daily severe pain rated at 7-10/10. Associated with bilateral lower extremity pain, tingling and numbness. Pain exacerbated by prolonged stationary positions, exertional activities, pushing/pulling/lifting, standing, bending backwards and alleviated by pain medications and rest. She was previously taking pain medications. To this point, with conservative care, the patient has not improved and/or been restored to preinjury status.",
            "Interim History": "First injection having 50% improvement, with associated increased ease with ADLs, status post C7-T1 interlaminar epidural steroid injection under fluoroscopic guidance 04/09/20. However second injection had minimal improvement. Reports last occipital nerve block was only helpful for a few days. Overall frustrated that her pain continues and is not improving.",
            "Key physical exam findings": "Cervical spine: cervical rigidity/spasm, tender medial scapular muscles, tender paraspinal muscles, limited range of motion to stiffness, bilateral trapezius tenderness, equivocal Spurling's test. Lumbar spine: somewhat flattened lordosis, pain with extension, tenderness over paralumbar extensors and facet joints, limited range of motion due to pain and stiffness, equivocal straight leg raise test.",
            "Diagnoses/assessment": "1) Driver injured in collision with other motor vehicles in traffic accident, sequela. 2) Low back pain. 3) Cervicalgia. 4) Myalgia, other site. 5) Neuralgia and neuritis, unspecified. 6) Other chronic pain. 7) Sprain of joints and ligaments of other parts of neck, sequela. 8) Strain of muscle, fascia and tendon at neck level, sequela. 9) Unspecified injury of muscle, fascia and tendon of lower back, initial encounter.",
            "Treatment plan and recommendations": "Patient has now reached a plateau stage in recovery after extensive workup/treatment. Residual symptoms wax and wane. Recommend/continue home exercise regimen. To assist with flareup management, future care provisions may include: medication refills as needed, repeat imaging for worsening symptoms, repeat injection(s) for worsening symptoms, referral for therapy services (6-12 sessions per flareup, for expected 2-3 flareups/year).",

            "Treatment plan and recommendations": "Proceed with left occipital nerve block. Discussed risks of steroid injections especially with COVID pandemic and possible decreased immunity. Patient understands risks and wishes to proceed. Future consideration may include trigger point, joint, or spinal injection based on progress with conservative care and imaging review. May employ judicious use of medication management as needed for symptom control. Adjunct therapies such as acupuncture or electric stimulation might also be of benefit. May also consider surgical referral.",
            "Procedures": "After discussing benefits and possible side effects, informed consent was obtained to proceed with bilateral occipital nerve blocks injection(s) targeting the left greater and less occipital nerves. Using aseptic technique, a total of 1cc of 0.5% bupivacine mixed with 10 mg of Kenalog was injected into the lesser and greater occipital nerve on each side. Aspiration revealed no blood or other fluid. The patient tolerated the procedure well without adverse effects. The patient experienced substantial pain relief immediately after procedure. Patient was instructed on post procedure care, including extreme caution while driving for 8 hours and to be aware of potential dizziness."

For left sided neck pain and stiffness radiating to the left arm, PT and accupuncture has been helpful for conservatively managing symptoms. However, they remain persistent. Will refer for additional accupuncture and physical therapy treatment. If still persistent or residual symptoms, will request surgical consultation. Future consideration may include trigger point, joint, or spinal injection based on progress with conservative care and imaging review. May employ judicious use of medication management as needed for symptom control. Adjunct therapies such as acupuncture or electric stimulation might also be of benefit.
