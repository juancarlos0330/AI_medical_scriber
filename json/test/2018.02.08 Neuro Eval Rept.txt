NEUROSURGICAL EVALUATION
I evaluated the patient in clinic on February 08, 2018.

twist in his lower back and felt sharp pain in the left lower lumbar region radiating to his foot.
Patient fell to the ground. Patient was able to stand after a few minutes and went to the
emergency room at the Montclair hospital with a co-worker. At the emergency patient
complained of lower back pain and a sharp pain down the left leg. Patient had X-rays and
evaluated and was release on pain medications. Patient continued to have left sided low back
pain and leg pain and saw a chiropractor. Patient is presently treating three times a week with
minor relief if any. Patient was sent to MRI center because of the numbness and the pain in the
left leg and onset of weakness in the left leg. He is here today for evaluation. Patient does not
report any bowel or bladder incontinence.
Patient use to be highly active prior to the subject incident. Use to hike with friends, play with
his daughter. He can't run or jog because of his pain.
CURRENT STATUS: Lower back pain is 8/10 intensity. Pain is described as an achy/dull in
the lower back, constant. "I have to stop sometimes every 20 minutes because the pain." The
left leg is numb constantly.
TREATMENTS: Chiropractic care, anti-inflammatoirectivity modification.
PREVIOUS INJURIES: No prior falls, work related injuries or car accidents. No prior back

Lumbar Spine:
Tenderness to palpation in the midline L4 to S1. Tenderness over the left paralumbar region and
SI joint. Moderate-to-severe paralumbar spasm on the left.
Straight Leg Raise: localized pain in the lumbar radiating to the left bittock and posterior thigh
to the level of the knee at 60 degrees in the sitting position.

REVIEW OF RECORDS:
1. January 29, 2018. MRI of the lumbar spine.
Impression:
1. 1.5-81:
There Is a 7 to 8 mm left paracentral disc protrusion with severe lateral recess
stenosis and neural foraminal narrowing bilaterally greater on the left than the
right with Impingement no the L5 and SI nerve roots on the left. There Is no
significant central spinal canal stenosis.
2. L4-L5:
There is a 2 to 3 mm dise protrusion with moderate neural foraminal narrowing
bilaterally greater on the left than the right. There is no significant central
spinal canal stenosis.
3. L3-L4:
There is a 2 mm dise bulge with mild neural foraminal narrowing bilaterally.
There is no significant central spinal canal stenosis.
4. L2-1.3;
There is a 2 mm disc bulge with mild neural foraminal narrowing bilaterally and
no significant central spinal canal stenosis.

IMAGING STUDIES: I reviewed the MRI of the lumbar spine dated January 29, 2018
personally. This study is significant for posterior disc protrusions at L3-4, L4-5 and L5-S1
levels. Intervertebral disc height and hydration is maintained in all the intervertebral disc spaces
in the lumbar region except for the L5-S1 level. There is a left paracentral posterior disc
protrusion at the L5-S1 level with intraforaminal extension with compression of the exiting L5
nerve root and displacement of the traversing S1 nerve root on the left side. This measures
approximately 6-7 mm in the AP diameter.
DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION:
1. Status post a fall with lumbar spine trauma and left lower extremity radiculopathy
2. Intractable back pain and left lower extremity radiculopathy, evidence of a 6-7 mm left
paracentral disc herniation L5-S1 level.
3. Lack of improvement from conservative measures and medical therapy.
DISCUSSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS: I reviewed the conical findings and imaging
findings with patient in detail. I spent at least 50 minutes of face-to-face time discussing his
condition with him and going over the imaging studies.
Based upon history, physical
examination and review of the available imaging studies and records, I'm of the opinion that the
subject accident is directly responsible for his injuries. Patient did not have antecedent history of
back pain radiculopathy and was highly active. In the aftermath of the accident, he has had
medical reasonable and necessary interventions which were related to the subject accident. He
continues to have significant symptoms of back pain or radiculopathy which are concordant with
his MRI finding. I discussed the treatment options with him in detail. Options include
continuation of medical therapy, lumbar epidural injections versus surgical intervention. He
does not want to have injections due to temporary effect. Given the severity of his left-sided
radiculopathy and lack of improvement from conservative measures, he is a surgical candidate.
Recommended procedure is posterior lumbar decompressive surgery left L5-S1 microdiscectomy
and application of epidural fat graft. Risk of the operation including but not limited to the risk of
infection, bleeding, nerve damage, paralysis, death, worsening back pain or lack of improvement
of the lower back pain requiring instrumented fusion were all discussed with him using a spinal
model. Cost of the operation, including facility surgeon anesthesiologist internal medicine
evaluation and appropriate labs and workup is possibly $100,000. Patient will think about his
options and will contact this office in case he wants to proceed with the surgery.
