Procedure Note
Formatting of this note might be different from the original.
TECHNIQUE:
The study is performed after injection of 0.2ml of Magnevist into the
shoulder joint.
1. Coronal oblique T1 fat sat and T2 fat sat.
2. Axial T1 and axial T1 fat sat.
3. Sagittal T1 fat sat.
PROCEDURE: Written informed consent was obtained from the patient
with explanation of the risks and benefits of the procedure,
including the risk of bleeding, infection and medication reaction.
The patient wished to proceed with the procedure. Timeout procedure
was performed with verification of patient name, birthday, side of
procedure and type of procedure.
The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. The
site was marked with a sterile pen. Under real-time fluoroscopic
guidance with 5ml of 1-percent Xylocaine for local anesthesia, a 20
gauge needle was introduced into the shoulder joint from an anterior
approach. Intraarticular location was confirmed with 2mL of omnipaque
contrast. Then, 15mL of a mixture of
normal saline with 0.25% Marcaine and 0.25mL of Magnevist was
injected into the shoulder joint. The needle was removed
The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate
complication and left
the fluoroscopic suite in stable condition.
CONTRAST: 0.2mL gadavist
Comparison is made with prior study from 2/22/2020.
BONES/ARTICULAR CARTILAGE: There is no acute fracture or dislocation.
Articular Cartilage is intact. Nonspecific cystic change at the
humeral head.
EFFUSIONS: There is contrast in the joint. Contrast extends into the
bursa. No joint body is seen.
ACROMIOCLAVICULAR JOINT: There is superior displacement of the distal
clavicle in relation to the coracoid and the coracoacromial distance
is 2 cm, consistent with acromioclavicular joint sprain injury. There
is evidence of tear of the trapezoid ligament. Mild edema in the
distal clavicle and acromion with a small joint effusion and mild
degenerative change. No fracture is seen of the clavicle.
ROTATOR CUFF: Full thickness tear of the supraspinatus tendon
measuring 1.9 x 1.1 cm (series 7, image 12 and series 5, image 21).
Infraspinatus, teres minor and subscapularis tendons are intact
without tear.
LABRUM: There is mild uptake of contrast in the posterior, superior
labrum system with mild degeneration without definite tear.
BICEPS TENDON AND ANCHOR: The biceps tendon and anchor are intact.
MISCELLANEOUS: There is no muscle edema, muscle atrophy or muscle
retraction.
IMPRESSION:
1. Full-thickness tear of the supraspinatus tendon.
2. Widening of the coracoclavicular space with evidence of
acromioclavicular joint sprain and tear of the trapezoid ligament.
3. Small joint effusion of the acromioclavicular joint.

Comment:
There is general consensus (Endocrine Society, Natl Osteoporosis FDN, K_DOQI)
that 25-OH Vitamin D measurements > 30 ng/ml are desirable. However, most
Americans are deficient by this standard (NHanes III).
Levels <10 ng/ml are consistent with a diagnosis of Rickets/Osteomalacia.
Infants normally produce Vitamin D metabolites that falsely elevate 25-OH
Vitamin D measurements. Please order D, 25-Hydroxy, Neonatal [82306D] for these
patients.
This test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by each
applicable laboratory in the Southern California Permanente Medical Group
Laboratory System where the test is performed. It has not been cleared or
approved by the FDA. Each applicable laboratory is regulated under CLIA as
qualified to perform high-complexity testing. This test is used for clinical
purposes. It should not be regarded as investigational or for research.

Use Authorization (EUA) .
Test results are for the identification of SARS-COV-2 RNA, which may be
detectable in samples submitted during the acute phase of infection.
Positive / Detected. SARS-Cov-2 RNA present.
Negative / Not Detected results for SARS-Cov-2 do not rule out COVID-19
infection and should not be used as the sole basis for patient management.
Negative / Not Detected results must be combined with other information such
as patient history, clinical observations and epidemiology. Resubmit if
clinically indicated.
Presumptive Positive. Not all COVID-19 targets detected. Consider the test
POSITIVE if there was a high pre-test probability of COVID-19 infection.
Consider repeat testing if clinically indicated.
Inconclusive. Not all COVID-19 targets detected. Consider repeat testing if
clinically indicated.
For "Invalid" results a new specimen needs to be obtained for retesting.

Comment:
The preferred test to diagnose acute COVID-19 is SARS-COV-2, NAA (COVID-19),
KP LAB [87635M].
Negative serology results do not exclude acute SARS-Cov-2 infection.
Serologic testing may help with persons who present at least 14 days after
symptom onset, or with possible late complications of COVID-19 illness, such
as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children.
Serology should not be used to make decisions about returning persons to the
workplace, school, or correctional facility, nor about the use of personal
protective equipment.

FINDINGS:
Acromioclavicular joint: There are moderate hypertrophic changes of
the acromioclavicular joint. There is a mild subacromial/subdeltoid
bursitis.
Rotator cuff: There is a 1.5 cm near full thickness tear of the
supraspinatus tendon at the foot print with retraction of the torn
fibers approximately 1.6 cm. There is fraying and partial thickness
tearing of the bursal surface fibers of the footprint of the
posterior infraspinatus tendon (series 7, image 8). There is mild
tendinosis of the subscapularis tendon with an 8 mm possible
intrasubstance tear.
Muscles:No significant muscle atrophy.
Biceps tendon: The long head of the biceps tendon is intact.
Labrum:No displaced labral tear.
Glenohumeral joint:No joint effusion. No high grade chondral defect.
There is mild edema in the rotator interval and around the inferior
joint capsule/IGHL.
Bone:No suspicious bone marrow signal. No occult fracture. There
are subcortical cystic changes in the posterior lateral humeral head.

Comment:
Please see below for interpretive criteria:
NON-REACTIVE: HIV Antigen and antibodies not detected; the patient remains
susceptible - patients at behavioral risk should receive counseling. If early
infection is suspected, consider repeat testing in 6-8 weeks.
REACTIVE: HIV-1/2 Confirmatory Test to Follow. The HIV-1/2 confirmatory test
result is needed in order to determine whether or not the patient is truly
positive for HIV-1 or HIV-2.

Comment:
There is general consensus (Endocrine Society, Natl Osteoporosis FDN, K_DOQI)
that 25-OH Vitamin D measurements > 30 ng/ml are desirable. However, most
Americans are deficient by this standard (NHanes III) .
Levels <10 ng/ml are consistent with a diagnosis of Rickets/Osteomalacia.
Infants normally produce Vitamin D metabolites that falsely elevate 25-OH
Vitamin D measurements. Please order D, 25-Hydroxy, Neonatal [82306D] for these
patients.
This test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by each
applicable laboratory in the Southern California Permanente Medical Group
Laboratory System where the test is performed. It has not been cleared or
approved by the FDA. Each applicable laboratory is regulated under CLIA as
qualified to perform high-complexity testing. This test is used for clinical
purposes. It should not be regarded as investigational or for research.

CLINICAL HISTORY: Reason: standing ap Lateral and sunrise
COMPARISON: No previous study available.
FINDINGS/
IMPRESSION:
LEFT KNEE (3 views):
No acute fracture is identified. The alignment is normal.
There are bony defects with sclerosis in the distal femur and
proximal tibia, more likely due to prior anterior cruciate ligament ..
There are degenerative changes with moderate narrowing of the
patellofemoral space and mild narrowing at the medial and lateral
femoral tibial joint spaces. There is spurring at the patella and
minimal marginal osteophyte formation at the medial and lateral
knee.
There is a well-corticated bony opacity below the patella which may
be due to old trauma or a loose body.

Comment:
DIRECT LDL: For patients having elevated triglyceride levels, i.e. >400
mg/dl, the direct LDL-C result may not represent the patient's LDL-C status
upon restoration of triglycerides to lower levels. These patients should not
be assumed to have representative LDL-C levels until triglyceride levels are
reduced.
